# Each list item represents one document class
# - label: Identifies the document class
# - filename_regex: List of regexes to look for in the filename
# - fuzzy_keywords: Keywords for filename fuzzy matching
# - content_regex:
#     - required: Must be present in the document's extracted text
#     - supporting: Boosts confidence when present, but ultimately more generic
#     - negative: Must not be present

# label is the only required field â€” other fields can be omitted to skip certain parts of the classification pipeline for a given class (e.g., some classes might only use content matching without filename examination)
